# Security Analysis

Comprehensive security testing results for the GKR zero-knowledge proof 
system including:

- **Mathematical attacks**: Sum-check polynomial forgery, degree bound violations
- **Cryptographic attacks**: Commitment substitution, transcript manipulation
- **Binary validation**: Proof corruption, trailing data injection
- **Field overflow**: Extreme value edge cases
- **Zero-knowledge**: Information leakage analysis

## Attack Resistance

The GKR implementation has been tested against multiple attack vectors:

### Mathematical Attacks
- **Sum-check polynomial forgery**: System correctly rejects invalid polynomial constructions
- **Degree bound violations**: Proper validation of polynomial degree constraints
- **Challenge manipulation**: Fiat-Shamir transcript prevents challenge prediction
- **MLE evaluation attacks**: Multilinear extension proofs resist forgery attempts

### Cryptographic Attacks
- **Commitment substitution**: Merkle tree roots properly bind to proof data
- **Transcript manipulation**: SHA256-based Fiat-Shamir provides 128-bit security
- **Binary proof corruption**: Complete validation of proof file integrity
- **Hash collision attempts**: Cryptographic primitives resist standard attacks

### Implementation Security
- **Memory safety**: Rust guarantees prevent buffer overflows and memory corruption
- **Constant-time operations**: Field arithmetic uses arkworks constant-time implementations
- **Serialization integrity**: Binary proof format includes comprehensive validation
- **Error handling**: All failure modes provide appropriate security boundaries

## Security Features

- **Zero-knowledge**: Proofs reveal no information about private weight matrix W
- **Soundness**: <2^-128 probability of accepting invalid computations
- **Completeness**: Valid computations always generate acceptable proofs
- **Non-malleability**: Proofs cannot be modified without invalidation
